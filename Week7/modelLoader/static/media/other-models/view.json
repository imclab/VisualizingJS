{"username": "henrik", "description": "The Bell P-39 Airacobra was one of the principal American fighter aircraft in service at the start of World War II. Although its mid-engine placement was innovative, the P-39 design was handicapped by the lack of an efficient turbo-supercharger, limiting it to low-altitude work. The P-39 was used with great success by the Soviet Air Force, who scored the highest number of individual kills attributed to any U.S. fighter type. Other important users were the Free French and co-belligerent Italian air forces. Together with the derivative P-63 Kingcobra, these aircraft would be the most successful mass-produced, fixed-wing aircraft manufactured by Bell.\n\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=5d73fb0f116292035f91a101e78f22f&amp;prevstart=0", "license": "This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.<br>                More information about this license can be obtained <br/>                <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/'>here</a><br/><br/><img src='/cclogo.png'/><br/><br/><br/>", "author": "CK", "dbid": "2312", "title": "Bell P-39 Airacobra ", "userid": "40", "bounds": [352.37903999999997, 101.80959299999999, 94.869625500000012], "up_axis": "Z_UP", "db": "None", "o3dscene": "model", "preview": "true", "center": [0.0, 72.204977, 83.639522499999998]}
